/**
 * Serializable collections (and Maps). These can be used as drop-in replacements for the classic collection interfaces
 * from <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/index.html?java/util/package-summary.html"></a>
 * <code>java.util</code></a>. The difference is that these classes require that the elements of the collections are
 * also serializable.
